# INDIAai_Hackathon ðŸŒˆðŸ¤– 
This is a project part of cybersecurity hackathon @ indiaai.gov.in to develop NLP model to effectively classify fraud based on user inputs into type of fraud categories.

## **Dataset Overview**
*This	hackathon	presents	a	rich,	unstructured	text	dataset	consisting	of	approximately	1.56	
lakh	rows.	The	primary	challenge	is	to	classify	these	raw	text	descriptions	into	subcategories	
then	 into	 categories.	 While	 the	 names	 of	 the	 categories	 and	 subcategories	 are	 provided,	
participants	are	expected	to	explore	the	dataset	to	understand	and	define	the	meaning	and	
context	 of	each	 category. Participants	are	expected	 to	ensure	 that	 the	 definitions	 of	 these	
categories	and	subcategories	are	aligned	with	Government of	India rules	and	regulations.
The	dataset	is	entirely	raw,	and	no	prior	pre-processing	has	been	performed.	Participants	
will	have	full	control	over	the	entire	pipeline,	from	text	cleaning	and	preparation	to	feature	
engineering	and	model	development.	The	unstructured	nature	of	the	data	offers	a	range	of	
challenges that	must	be	addressed	by	the	participants,	such	as:*
1. Handling	messy	text,	including	typos,	inconsistencies,	or	abbreviations
2. Addressing	potential	ambiguities	in	the	descriptions
3. Managing	imbalances	between	categories	and	subcategories
4. Privilege	escalation.

## **Data Splits**
1. Training	Set	(60%):	Unlabeled	data	for	model	development associated	with	both	a	
category	and	subcategory.
2. Testing	Set	(20%):	Unlabeled	data	for	model	evaluation	during	development.
3. Validation	Set	(20%):	Held-back	data	for	unbiased	final	assessment.
>*Participants	are	encouraged	to	experiment	with	a	variety	of	models	and	techniques,	ranging	
from	 traditional	 methods	 to	 state-of-the-art	 NLP	 models.	 There	 are	 no	 limitations	 on	 the
choice	 of	 models	 or	 approaches.	 Popular	 techniques	 like	 BERT,	 TF-IDF,	 or	 even	 more
traditional	algorithms	like	Naive	Bayes	or	SVM	can	be	utilized,	depending	on	the participant's	
preferred	approach	to	text	classification*

## **Key Expectations**
1. Perform	Exploratory	Data	Analysis	(EDA)	to	uncover	patterns	and	insights	within	the	
text.
2. Implement	 text	 pre-processing	 strategies,	 such	 as	 cleaning,	 tokenization,	 and	
normalization.
3. Develop	 models	 to	 accurately	 classify	 text	 descriptions	 into	 the	 appropriate	
categories	and	subcategories.
4. Focus	 on	 the	 entire	 model	 evaluation	 pipeline,	 from	 EDA	 to	 the	 final	 modelâ€™s	
performance	metrics.
5. Participants	 are	 encouraged	 to	 leverage	 a	 variety	 of	models	 and	 techniques,	 from	
traditional	methods	to	state-of-the-art	NLP	models.	There	are	no	restrictions	on	the	
choice	 of	 models	 or	 approaches,	 as	 long	 as	 they	 effectively	 address	 the	 task	 of	
classifying	 the	 raw	 text	 descriptions.	 Creativity,	 depth	 of	 analysis,	 and	 model	
performance	will	be	key	differentiators
